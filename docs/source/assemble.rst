=======================

After getting familiar with the components in the

In the next steps, there are a lot of details you need to 
notice, especially the assembly position of the battery 
and the clear acrylic back cover.

    .. warning::
        When you put the battery in for the first time or when the battery is unplugged and put in again, the battery will not work properly, at this time, you need to plug the Type C cable into the charging port to turn off the protection circuit, and the battery can be used normally.
